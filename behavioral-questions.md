# ASSESSMENT 3: Behavioral Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. Use the Nugget + STAR method for each answer.

1. Tell me about a project or accomplishment youâ€™re proud of.

- Nugget: One of the achievements I'm most proud of was when I was a truck driver was successfully leading a long-haul logistics project that involved delivering critical supplies to a disaster-stricken area.
- Situation: I was working for a logistics company, and we received a request to transport emergency relief supplies to a disaster-stricken region that was challenging to access due to damaged infrastructure.
- Task: The task was to deliver essential supplies such as food, water, and medical equipment to the affected area within a tight timeframe while navigating difficult road conditions.
- Action: To achieve this, I meticulously planned the route, considering the quickest and safest way to reach the destination. I coordinated with the logistics team to ensure we had the right supplies and permits in place. The journey itself was grueling, involving long hours of driving on rugged roads, often with little rest. I made sure to inspect the truck regularly and perform any necessary maintenance to prevent breakdowns. Moreover, I communicated regularly with the local authorities and support teams on the ground to adapt to any changing circumstances.
- Result: Despite the considerable challenges, we successfully delivered the critical relief supplies to the area within the designated timeframe. It was a highly rewarding experience as a truck driver, knowing that our efforts contributed to disaster relief and helped those who were affected.



2. Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a high-pressure situation in your job.

- Nugget: One of the most challenging high-pressure situations I encountered as a screw compressor mechanic was when a critical compressor failure threatened to halt production in a manufacturing facility.
- Situation: I was working at a manufacturing plant that heavily relied on screw compressors to power various production lines. During a busy production cycle, one of the key compressors suddenly malfunctioned, causing a significant drop in air pressure and potentially leading to costly production downtime.
- Task: The task was to diagnose and repair the compressor failure as quickly as possible, with the overarching goal of minimizing downtime and ensuring the manufacturing process continued smoothly.
- Action: In response to this critical situation, I immediately went to the site and assessed the compressor. I quickly identified a problem with the compressor's motor and cooling system. Recognizing the urgency, I gathered a team of fellow mechanics and coordinated with the production managers. We decided to bypass the malfunctioning compressor temporarily and redistribute the workload among the other compressors to maintain production. While the production lines were running, I focused on repairing the failed compressor. I led my team in dismantling the motor, identifying the faulty components, and sourcing replacement parts as swiftly as possible. We worked around the clock, ensuring that each step of the repair process was meticulously executed.
- Result: Through our collective efforts and round-the-clock work, we managed to repair the screw compressor in record time, preventing any extended production downtime. The manufacturing facility was able to continue its operations without significant disruption, and the cost savings from avoiding prolonged downtime were substantial. This high-pressure situation demonstrated our ability to work under extreme time constraints, adapt to challenges, and uphold the efficiency of the manufacturing process.
